## Usage

1. Install the package in your project: `npm install react-native-swipeable-list` or `yarn add react-native-swipeable-list`

2. Import the component into your component: `import SwipeableFlatList from 'react-native-swipeable-list';`

3. Pass it a data array. It inherits [FlatListProps from the standard `FlatList` component from react-native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/flatlist).

It can be passed additional props:

- `shouldBounceOnMount` (default = `true`) - To alert the user that swiping is possible, the first row can bounce on component mount. Type `boolean`

- `maxSwipeDistance` - Maximum distance to open to after a swipe. Type `number || (Object => number)`

- `renderQuickActions` - Callback method to render the view that will be unveiled on swipe. Type `renderItemType` (which provides `index` and  `item`, which will be very useful for performing actions on your items)
  
- `disableSwipe` - (default = `false`) - Allows to disable swiping or not.  Type `boolean`


## Example

Check out the example in the `/examples` folder. Clone this repo, then `cd examples && yarn install && yarn start` and then either  `react-native run-ios` or `react-native run-android` to get the app up and running locally. Play with the code and see what you can do! ðŸ˜Ž

## History & Shoutouts
